## 1. Project Vision

## 2. Target Audience

* Working professionals in London with demanding schedules.
* Affluent tourists and travellers requiring last-minute, reliable childcare in hotels.

## 3. Core Design Principles

* **Modern & Stunning:** A visually appealing interface that communicates quality and exclusivity.

* **Trust & Safety:** Design elements that build confidence and underscore the platform's commitment to security and thorough vetting.
* **Responsive & Accessible:** A seamless experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

## 4. Colour Palette

The colour scheme will be sophisticated, calming, and professional.

* **Primary:** Deep Navy (`#001f3f`) - Used for primary buttons, key headers, and core branding elements to convey trust and professionalism.
* **Secondary:** Soft Cream (`#FDFBF7`) - Used for page backgrounds to create a warm, inviting, and clean canvas.
* **Accent:** Gold (`#D4AF37`) - Used for highlights, important icons, and to add a touch of luxury.
* **Text:** Charcoal (`#333333`) - For main body text to ensure high readability.
* **Success:** Muted Teal (`#48BB78`) - For confirmations and success messages.
* **Error:** Soft Terracotta (`#E57373`) - For alerts and error messages.

## 5. Typography

* **Headings:** A sophisticated serif font such as "Playfair Display" to convey elegance and authority.
* **Body & UI Elements:** A clean and highly legible sans-serif font like "Inter" or "Manrope" for all other text to ensure clarity.

## 6. UI/UX Elements

* **Imagery:** High-quality, professional photographs of nannies and children in bright, modern London environments. Avoid stock photos where possible.
* **Buttons:** Softly rounded corners, clear labels, and subtle hover/active states.
* **Forms:** Clean, well-spaced input fields with clear labels that float within the field on focus.
* **Cards:** Nanny profiles and booking summaries will be displayed on clean cards with a clear visual hierarchy.
* **Icons:** A consistent set of minimalist, outlined icons.
